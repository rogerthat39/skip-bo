## Skip-Bo
This is a text game written in Python and based on the card game "Skip Bo". The rules are based on how my family used to play, which I believe are the rules for "quick play". Rather than keep track of points, we just played until the first person put out all their stock pile cards.

This game is to be played with 2-4 players. At the start of the game, you can pick how many computer players you wish to play against. There is currently no way to play with two or more human players.

## How to play
The cards used in Skip-Bo go from 1-12, and there are "wild" cards called Skip-Bo cards also in the deck. These are represented in-game with the letter "W".

Each player is dealt 10 cards to their <b>Stock Pile</b>. These cards are placed face down on the table, with the top card turned over for all players to see. The main objective is to get rid of all the cards in the Stock Pile.

When it is your turn, draw five cards from the <b>Draw Pile</b>. If you already have cards in your hand from a previous turn, draw as many cards as it will take to reach five cards. If you put out all five cards in the same turn (not counting the card you put down to end your turn), you can draw 5 more from the Draw Pile. Drawing cards is done automatically.

There are four spaces for <b>Building Piles</b> which any player can add to on their turn. Once a building pile reaches 12, it is automatically cleared.

When you are to end your turn, put down one card from your hand to a <b>Discard Pile</b>. There are four Discard Piles for each player, and you cannot use another player's cards from their Discard Piles. There is no limit to how many cards can be in a Discard Pile, or what order they should be in. During a player's turn, they can put out a card they have previously discarded, as long as it is on top of the corresponding Discard Pile.

The game ends when one player gets rid of all the cards in their Stock Pile.
